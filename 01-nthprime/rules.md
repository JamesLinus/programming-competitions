The 1st Great PdgnCo Programming Competition
--------------------------------------------

We're gonna have a little competition 'round these parts, and it may get bloody but dwai.

Da Goal
-------

Given a number, n, as an argument to your program, print the nth prime.


Submission
----------

Details TBA, but you're gonna need to provide a makefile for installing your language compiler/runtime stuff, compiling (if necessary) and running

Submissions due at 11:55 on Feb. 28.

Da Rulez
--------

1. No libraries outside of your language's standard library.
    a. If your language's standard library contains utilities for determining the primality of a number, those are prohibited as well
2. Programs that generate incorrect solutions will be disqualified.
3. Programs' scores are the amount of User time they take, as reported by the unix `time` utility. Lowest score wins.
4. Programs must do the computations during their own runtime
    a. No compile-time generation of answers
    b. No shelling out to a web service for answers
    c. No forking a daemon and querying that on subsequent runs
    d. No sticking answers in a file and looking there on the next run
    e. If you do something that the judges feel is cheating, your program can be disqualified.
